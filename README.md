# kaplan-challenge
This is a simple React client app that pulls weather information from a public api and uses a simple word manipulation API that I created.  I had trouble finding a 2nd free api.  I started with a skeleton project I used for another project, so there may still be some references to it.

## Notes
`nodejs` must be installed

The following environment variables should be set:
* WEATHER_KEY - api key from https://openweathermap.org/

## Using the  app
To run locally:
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run build`
1. Run `npm start'
1. Point browser to 'http://localhost:8080`

## TODO
1. Make the page look better
1. Add a drop down menu so the user can choose if they want to scrub or reverse the city name
1. Write tests
